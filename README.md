#Home (aka: Alex's dotfiles)

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

## Usage

To install, clone this repo wherever you want:

`git clone https://github.com/alexweber/home.git && home/install.sh`

To update, go the directory where you cloned the repo and run:

`git pull && ./install.sh`

## Additional stuff

* `osx.sh` Sets up sensible defaults for OS X settings and a couple other cool tweaks
* `brew.sh` Install command-line tools using Homebrew
* `cask.sh` Install native OS X apps using Homebrew Cask
